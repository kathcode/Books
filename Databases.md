## SQL

### What is SQL?
Structured Query language (SQL): Is the standard language for relational databases.

Relationa: relationship in form of tables.

### What is NoSQL?
Not Only SQL (NoSQL): Non-relational database, do not need fixed schema, and is easy to scale.

No declarative query language needed.

### Diferences
Type | SQL | NoSQL
--- | --- | ---
Language | Use Structured Query Language for manipulating data | Dynamic schemas for unstructured data
Scalability | Vertically: To increase the load on a single server by increasing components like RAM, SSD, or CPU | orizontally: increased traffic simply by adding more servers to the database
Structure | SQL databases are table-based which makes them a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions. | NoSQL databases can be key-value pairs, wide-column stores, graph databases, or document-based.
